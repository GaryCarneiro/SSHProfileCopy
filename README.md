SSHProfileCopy
==============

This script copies all shell profiles from a config directory to the Remote system through SSH.

$ bin/rssh.rb server.example.com                # Good

$ bin/rssh.rb server.example.com foobar         # Better
This is  a branch for batch copy of file and also a differentiation between prod and non prod
